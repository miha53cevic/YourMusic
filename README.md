## Creating playlists
Just drag and drop your songs into a new folder, for example myplaylist
The file structure would then look like

    - myplaylist
        - song1
        - song2
    - mysecondplaylist
        - song3
        - song4

Music can be placed anywhere in your android filesystem, the only requirement are that the songs are .mp3 format!!!
